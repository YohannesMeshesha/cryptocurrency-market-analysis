# Cryptocurrency-market-analysis

Before delving into the analysis of the report, it's important to understand what cryptocurrency is and why analyzing it is important.

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank. It is decentralized, meaning it is not subject to government or financial institution control, and can be transferred directly between individuals without intermediaries. Cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular in recent years, with Bitcoin being the most well-known and widely traded.

Analyzing cryptocurrency data is important for several reasons. Firstly, it allows investors to make informed decisions about their investments based on data-driven insights. Secondly, it helps identify patterns and trends in the market, which can provide valuable information for traders and analysts. Thirdly, it can provide insights into the broader economic landscape, as cryptocurrency markets are often affected by global events and trends.


Firstly, the report is a comprehensive analysis of the top 7 traded coins in the cryptocurrency market such as ETH: Ethereum,BTC: Bitcoin,Doge: Dogecoin,Steller: Stellar Lumens and XRP: Ripple (XRP). It uses a slicer to filter data by year and coin name, making it easier for users to focus on the data that matters most. The use of line charts to display trend line market cap by month and forecast for the next 12 months is a great visualization tool that allows users to quickly identify patterns and trends in the data. The use of cards to show Total market cap, High Average, low, and Volume each filtered by year and coin name is also an excellent idea. It makes it easy for users to get a quick overview of the data and identify important trends.
